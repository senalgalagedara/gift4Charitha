    Charitha Rakshitha Attalage, born on October 6, 1989, is a French-born Sri Lankan music producer currently based in Sri Lanka. Over the past 15 years, he has built a distinguished career as a versatile artist, serving as a Music Composer, Producer, Mixing Engineer, Recording Engineer, and Songwriter.
<br><br>
    At present, Charitha is recognized as one of Sri Lanka's most sought-after artisans, known for his genre-defying approach that fuses classical and contemporary music. His music spans a diverse range of genres, including Indian Classical, Electronica, Contemporary Indian Pop, Ambient, Acoustic, Drum & Bass, and Dubstep.
<br>
<br>
    During his childhood, he devoted himself to mastering the classical Tabla under the tutelage of the late Maestro Wijeyaratne Ranatunga. In his teenage years, he expanded his musical horizons by embracing electronic keyboards, drum machines, synthesizers, and MIDI instruments.
<br>
<br>
    Starting in 2010, Charitha embarked on an international music education journey, spanning Singapore, the UK, and culminating with the completion of his bachelor's degree in Music Technology at California State University Dominguez Hills. In recent years, he has made a name for himself by successfully conducting workshops and delivering public lectures on Audio Engineering at higher education institutions in Sri Lanka.
<br>
<br>
    Over time, Charitha honed his musical production skills, achieving notable milestones with breakthrough songs like "Kuweni." This accomplishment paved the way for him to curate an award-winning show titled "Kuweni," which earned a shared gold award at the WOW Awards in 2020 in the audio-visual film category, standing alongside his musical idol, maestro A R Rahman's concert series.
